Hi, I'm Jingcheng Liang(梁景程). I am currently a junior undergraduate Computer Science student in [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). 

My research interests concentrate on computational biology, particularly in leveraging machine learning methods in detecting SNP-SNP interactions and pathway interactions from GWAS data for genotype-phenotype prediction. I am now an undergraduate research volunteer in [Myers Lab](http://csbio.cs.umn.edu/), advised by [Prof. Chad Myers](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/chad-myers) and [Dr. Wen Wang](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/wen-wang).

I am now also working on empirical analysis of deep neural network structures in science learning object under [DFRACS program](https://cla.umn.edu/undergraduate-students/academics/research-opportunities/deans-first-year-research-creative-scholars) with [Prof. Tianxi Li](https://sites.google.com/view/tianxili-homepage/home?authuser=0).

Before transferring to [University of Minnesota Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/), I was an undergraduate student in [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/), majoring in Economics.
<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
